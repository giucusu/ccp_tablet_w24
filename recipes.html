            <img src="images/datebrownies-705x1024.jpeg" width = "400" alt="Prepared fudgy date brownies."> 
            <p>This is a recipe that swaps processed sugar for dates! Great for anyone trying to cut processed sugar. </p>
            </div>
        <div class="ingredients-and-instructions">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>1 1/2 cups pitted dates</p>
            <p>1 cup hot water</p>
            <p>3/4 cup unsalted butter softened (1 1/2 sticks)</p>
            <p>2 cold eggs</p>
            <p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
            <p>3/4 cup cocoa powder</p>
            <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
            <p>Sea salt for sprinkling</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Grease or line an 8x8 baking pan. Preheat oven to 350F.</p>
            <p>In a food processor or blender, puree the dates and hot water until smooth. Measure out a cup of the paste (mine yielded exactly a cup,) and transfer to a large bowl with the butter. Cream the butter and date paste until smooth. Add the eggs, one at a time and vanilla extract, mixing until fluffy and smooth. Add the cocoa and flour, and mix on low until well combined.</p>
            <p>Spread batter into prepared pan, smoothing with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle a little sea salt on top.</p>
            <p>Bake for 18-23 minutes, or until edges are set. Allow pan to cool while you prepare the glaze.</p>
            <p>Whisk together the butter, honey and cocoa powder. Add vanilla and whisk until smooth. If the glaze seems a little runny- add a dash more of cocoa powder. If it seems too thick- you can add a splash of milk. Drizzle over the brownies and sprinkle with more sea salt.</p>            
            <p>Brownies will last for up to a week in a sealed container in the fridge. </p>

        <div class="ingredients-and-instructions">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, divided</p>
            <p>3 cups All Purpose Flour, 375 grams</p>
            <p>2 tsp Cream of Tartar</p>
            <p>1 tsp Baking Soda</p>
            <p>1 tsp Ground Ginger</p>
            <p>½ tsp Ground Cinnamon</p>
            <p>¼ tsp Ground Cardamom</p>
            <p>¼ tsp Ground Cloves</p>
            <p>¼ tsp Ground Allspice</p>
            <p>¼ tsp Black Pepper</p>
            <p>½ tsp Salt</p>
            <p>1 ⅓ cup Granulated Sugar, 267g</p>
            <p>2 Eggs, room temp</p>
            <p>2 tsp Pure Vanilla Extract</p>

            <p>ROLLING SUGAR</p>
            <p>⅓ cup Granulated Sugar, 70g</p>
            <p>1 tsp Ground Cinnamon</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and set aside</p>
            <p>Make the brown butter: melt 1 stick of butter in a small saucepan. Continue to melt, swirling around, until the mixture starts to foam up and you see small brown specks. The butter will start to smell nutty. Immediately remove from heat, transfer to a small bowl, and set aside to slightly cool.</p>
            <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, spices, and salt, set aside.</p>
            <p>In your stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with a hand mixer), beat the remaining 1 stick of butter along with the cooled brown butter and granulated sugar on medium-high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3-4 minutes.</p>
            <p>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla extract and beat on medium speed until combined, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.</p>
            <p>Slowly add the dry ingredients in 3 stages, and mix just until combined.</p>
            <p>To Make the Rolling Sugar: combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.</p>
            <p>Roll cookie dough into 1" balls, and then roll in the cinnamon-sugar topping. Place about 3" apart on cookie sheets.</p>
            <p>Bake cookies for 10 minutes, rotating halfway in between. They should be lightly browned on the bottom but not on the top. If they look flat, cook another 1-2 minutes.</p>
            <p>Allow cookies to cool on the cookie sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</p>
            <p>Store in an airtight container and keep room temperature for up to 1 week. Or, place in the freezer for up to 3 months.</p>
